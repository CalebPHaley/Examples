Hi, I am Caleb Haley! I am a recent graduate from Southern New Hampshire University with a degree in Computer Science and a concentration
in software development.  Some of the languages that I have picked up on in school and have built on with my time out of school are 
primarily Java and Python.  I have used some front end technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, however I have been mainly focused on back-end development.  I am looking to expand on my skills and begin learning in the industry and further increase my skillset.

You can reach me by email at calebphaley@gmail.com
